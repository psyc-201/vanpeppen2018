## Introduction
Reflecting upon my project proposal feedback, I would like to continue replicating Van Peppen and colleagues (2018) study. The study aims to examine how generating explanations for oneself (i.e. self explanations) fosters critical thinking. Though this does not directly relate to my first year project, I am still interested in launching a study where I test how different types of explanation strategies (such as AI-generated vs self-explanations) shapes the way learners’ retain and critically think about science. Finally, replicating this study will balance both the challenge and feasibility of coding and familiarizing myself with R. Through these efforts, I hope to deepen my understanding on how different learning strategies foster critical thinking and better learning outcomes.

## Methods

### Power Analysis

### Planned Sample

Planned sample size and/or termination rule, sampling frame, known demographics if any, preselection rules if any.

### Materials

For both the pretest and posttest, participants will be administered the critical thinking (CT) skills test. The CT-skills test tried to measure critical thinking skills in two key categories. The first category was to understand how well people were able to logically reason. To test this, they implemented two exams that measured how susceptible participants are to believe in false information (Syllogistic Reasoning task) as well as how likely participants verify versus disprove claims (Wason Selection task). The second category the study aimed to assess was participants’ statistical reasoning skills. The first test they used was the Base-rate tasks to evaluate whether people prioritized anecdotal evidence over statistical findings. Additionally, they integrated the Conjunction tasks which measured how likely people bias statistics: such as believing events described in detail are more probable than a simplistic recount. 

For the intervention phase, the study provided CT-instructions that educated participants on what inductive versus deductive reasoning is. Additionally, the instructions integrated two worked examples per exam they were administered in the pretest. Then, participants practiced the learned skills with CT-practice material that allowed participants to apply their skills to four different scenarios, and explain why they came to their conclusions. With each test administered, participants were given a mental effort survey where they rated on a 9-point Likert scale (1 being extremely low effort to 9 being extremely high effort) on how much cognitive effort it took to complete the task.

### Procedure	

Participants signed the informed consent form before completing the pretest that measured their initial critical thinking skills through Qualtrics. Afterwards, they were given a paper packet of the CT-instruction, moving them to the intervention phase that taught participants different types of reasoning skills. Then, participants integrated what they learned by solving four practice problems by engaging in self-explanation. Once they completed the practice intervention, participants completed the immediate posttest. Two weeks later, participants were given a delayed posttest that involved the same questions as the immediate version. However, they were also tasked to rate how much mental effort was exerted in completing the questions. 

### Analysis Plan

Can also quote directly, though it is less often spelled out effectively for an analysis strategy section.  The key is to report an analysis strategy that is as close to the original - data cleaning rules, data exclusion rules, covariates, etc. - as possible.  

**Clarify key analysis of interest here**  You can also pre-specify additional analyses you plan to do.

### Differences from Original Study
One major concern of replicating this study is conducting a longtitudinal study. Addressing this feedback, I am planning to not add the delayed posttest portion of the study. The rationale behind this decision stems from the delayed posttest just measuring how well a student retained information from the task. The immediate posttest will be sufficient to compare how the CT training and self-explanations affected learning outcomes. Beyond this, other concerns raised was understanding how participants' engagement of the study would be impacted if moved to online. One way to test engagement is creating a survey at the end asking if they honestly used any distractions to account for transparent barriers in the study. Also, calculating a power analysis in R to find the amount of participants needed to get medium sized effects will be the next step. The final solution addresses the third feedback: obtaining the CT materials. By emailing the authors, I am hoping to also ask them whether adding all four CT measures are necessary in measuring critical thinking. If it is not, I will utilize their feedback and make the study go faster. This way, it can hopefully keep participants a little more engaged.

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

You can comment this section out prior to final report with data collection.

#### Actual Sample
  Sample size, demographics, data exclusions based on rules spelled out in analysis plan

#### Differences from pre-data collection methods plan
  Any differences from what was described as the original plan, or “none”.


## Results

```

### Confirmatory analysis

The analyses as specified in the analysis plan.  

*Side-by-side graph with original graph is ideal here*

### Exploratory analyses

Any follow-up analyses desired (not required).  

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.  

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt.  None of these need to be long.
